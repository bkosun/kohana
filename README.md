# Kohana PHP Framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lestor/kohana.svg?branch=3.3%2Fdevelop)](https://travis-ci.org/lestor/kohana)

Kohana is an elegant, open source, and object oriented HMVC framework built using PHP5, by a team of volunteers. It aims to be swift, secure, and small. The Kohana has been deprecated and is no longer supported by the core development team, but some projects still use it.

This repository is a fork of the Kohana 3.3 branch with some changes and improvements. The goal of the project is to ensure compatibility of Kohana with new versions of PHP and provide the ability to work in a modern environment.
